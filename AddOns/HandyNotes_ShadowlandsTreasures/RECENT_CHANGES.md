## Changed in v55

* Add the locations of the Locus Alcove Arrangements for the optional rooms (Camber, Fulgore, Rondure, Dormant)
* Add a point for the Sand Sand Everywhere achievement
* Add a point for Olea Manu, the Jiro vendor after their questline, not at all because I'm bitter that I didn't notice them and so missed out on a week of +50% cyphers, no
* Add various soulshapes / crittershapes across the Shadowlands (mostly the is the 9.1.5 ones)
* Domination Cache: note that the key can also drop from the Dreadlord Infiltrators
* Give the Pulp-Covered Relic its own icon so it's easier to pick out
