## Changed in v56

* Minor performance improvement: code checking whether you could learn an appearance from an item wasn't caching negative results and so was running more than it needed to
* You can hide all points related to an achievement from the right-click menu
* Cleaned up some duplication between point-groups and achievements
* Coreless Automa locations in Zereth Mortis (disabled by default, there's a lot)
* Missing Dormant Alcove Arrangement added, and explain the Requisites Originator it leads to
* Better explain the branching jumping puzzle routes for the Rondue Cache / Omnipotential Core schematic
* Show the Bulging Roots near Gluttonous Overgrowth, but only on your minimap
* Chicken Soul crittershape: position very slightly fixed
* Loyal Gorger and Dead Blancy: show progress like the newer mounts
