## Changed in v58

* Added the Mawsworn Supply Chest locations to Zereth Mortis because it (very rarely) contains the Spectral Mawrat's Tail
* Fill in various vignette IDs from earlier zones in the expansion, e.g. the daily calling treasures now have notable loot shown, as do the anima calling rares
* Spent perhaps too much time getting the Ardenweald Large Lunarlight Pod to have helpful nearby points on your minimap (I'm missing one set of options because it hasn't come up in the last few days so I can't narrow down which one ties to which quest...)
