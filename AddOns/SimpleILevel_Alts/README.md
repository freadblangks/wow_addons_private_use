**New for version 2.0: Dual-Spec support!**\\Now you can quickly see the equipped item level for each spec across all characters. Very useful for characters that have different gear sets per spec.

=== Features: ===
* Realtime tooltip updates whenever you change gear (for current character)
* Characters sorted by ilvl (descending)
* Hide/Show all Realms/Factions
* Hide/Show only max level or all characters
* Hide/Show average ilvl
* Hide individual characters
* Colorize the ilvl in tooltip by class or by weight (SiL default)

=== Requirements: ===
* [[http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/simple-ilevel|Simple iLevel]]
* OPTIONAL: A Data Broker Display addon ([[http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/titan-panel|Titan Panel]], [[http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/chocolatebar|Chocolate Bar]], [[http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka|Bazooka]], etc)\\Without any data broker display, the addon will use the standard minimap button.
