Tagging as v2.4.16


--------------------

funkydude:
	- bump toc
	- Remove compat code
	- Fix text for garrison button
	- The Blizzard animation bug is a bit more complicated than first anticipated, but we can easily fix the spinning issue in specific here for WoD by using the new timer API the client provides.
	- Borders: cleanup comments incase someone that can fix it actually reads it.
	- Border: Blizzard has broke the behavior of rotating textures in WoD. If you try to start them after PLAYER_LOGIN, they rotate blindingly fast. To try and work around this we set a 5 second delay after PLAYER_LOGIN before starting any rotations on WoD. This really is just an ugly hack to fix behavior that Blizzard broke, but such is life, and we have to deal with yet another Blizzard bug. Hopefully I won't have to increase this delay for people with long load times, which will adversely affect people with short load times.
	- Buttons: add another addon button.
	- Buttons: More addon buttons, WoD garrison button placeholder.
	- Add commented out code for hiding in combat.
	- Fix embedding SharedMediaWidgets.
	- Buttons: Add an :IsForbidden check when checking the current mouse focus.
