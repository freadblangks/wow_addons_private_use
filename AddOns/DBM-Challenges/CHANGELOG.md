## [r135](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/tree/r135) (2020-11-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/compare/r134...r135) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Challenges/releases)

- pass the loose arg on START events in torghast mod  
- Applied combat filters to all mob casts in torghast, to avoid situations where mobs fighting other mobs would cause some warnings to go off. Downside, this also has a chance to have warnings NOT go off if you or someone in your party isn't targetting the caster.  
- Changed timer handling to work for any mob universally, in a very inefficient way.  
- Added some new spells and first timers to Torghast mod  
- Added 2 more warnings to torghast  
- Added another spellId to fearsome howl  
- Hard disable torghast statstics, period.
