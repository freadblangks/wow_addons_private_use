==GarrisonCommander helps you when choosing the right follower for the right mission==
* 2.3.7.1
** Fix: Due to an issue in packaginc, 2.3.7 was build with no embedded libraries
** Fix: Party display for In Progress missions sometimes was not not showing the right followers.
** Fix: Matchmaking was trying too hard te get the lowest usefull follower, sometimes not achieving the best possible score
** Fix: Added missing library to GarrisonCommander-Broker. Most people already had that library so onoy a few ones were impacred from it
