Backed out temporary interface version number additions as this did not help the incorrect game version showing up in WOW download addon tools.
Found a new solution to address issue #231 that leaves "Deactivate Blizz Auto-complete" working.  So both issues #231 and #236 are now fixed.

An attempt to fix the issue where download tools show postal as for game version 8.3.0.
KyrosKrane discovered a performance improvement for express mail sending described in issue #230.  I have incorporated KyrosKrane performance improvement into this build.
