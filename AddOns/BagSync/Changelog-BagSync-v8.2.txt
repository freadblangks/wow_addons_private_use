--------------------

Xruptor:
	- -Updated the TOC to reflect new patch number. -Pushed fix for TradeSkill bug by @Ignifazius from GitHub
Ignifazius:
	- fixing TradeSKillFrame = nil
	it seems, if you haven't opened the profession window, the TradeSkillFrame
	simply doesnt exist. If you found another item with ID = 0 this would case
	a lua-error, saying the TradeSkillFrame is nil. Solution: just check if it
	is already there. IMPORTANT: first check if nil, THEN check if visible
	- limiting the ID=0 workaround
	some other frames also show ID=0 (link QuestMapFrame or TradeFrame), so
	limit this workaround to profession window
	- (heavy) workaround for missing entry in profession window (fix for issue #21) Since one of Blizzards get-functions sees to be breoken (returning 0 in the profession window), i tryed to fix it with a workaround: Check if ID is 0, then replace it with the resulting link by comparing the MouseOver & SelectedTradeSKill information.
