	- Omega via svn r12393: Text shorten to fix an overrun
	- Omega via svn r12392: Comment tweak
	- Omega via svn r12391: GUI refactoring. Options split into better sorting. users should be able to navigate GUI and more easily find what they are looking for now. Raid warnings are now JUST raid warnings. special warnings are now just special warnings. Voice alerts have their own area.

	- Omega via svn r12389: Missed some force nova stuff
	- Omega via svn r12388: Fix RBW sync
	- Omega via svn r12387: #Margok Update *Change branded yell to always show, even for 1 stack *Changed branded fortification to always special warn at 5 or more, instead of 7. *Fixed accelerated assault showing as a personal stack warning when in fact it's boss count warning. *Fixed nether energy showing personal stack warning when it's a count warning *Added timers/count for 2nd and 3rd nova's when fortified *Added voice warnings for branded *Added extra range check updates for better switch to 5 yard when chaos and nova happen at same time and tank isn't full out of range yet. *Fixed bug where accelerated assault taunt warning would call a bad taunt too close to mark of chaos cast. *Fixed bug where mark of chaos taunt warning would report unknown target. use boss name as target since boss stacks reason for swap. *Fixed bug where first infinite darkness timer maybe 2 seconds late

	- Omega via svn r12375: Some sounds, at least the ones findable with google. do to lack of casc explorers for mac os x i'm unable to find sound paths myself. if they aren't easily obtainable on internet they don't get added (which is why I didn't add any at all during mop).

	- Omega via svn r12356: Fix bug
	- Omega via svn r12355: bw version
	- nbluewiz via svn r12354: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12353: comment this out for now. sometimes boss mcs on 1, 3, 5 7, sometimes 2, 4, 6, 8. need to find cause of this. need to see if maybe ballsforgot needs +1. did not video so can't see if ballsforgot is cause of this.
	- Omega via svn r12352: Give frost target, because we can. Although no special warnings because it really doesn't matter much. if you are close to this person it's going to hit you and you can do nothing about you. only has initial damage so warning near you not help you avoid any damage or danger.

	- Omega via svn r12338: missed that version
	- Omega via svn r12337: Support banned mods in voice packs too, to prevent loading double voice packs (example, KiwiBeta vs Kiwi).
	- Omega via svn r12336: Add icon option for crystal barrage for phase 1 and 2 (tectus, and shards). disabled in phase 3 because motes can be messy, especially if their timers get out of sync then very very messy. Icons on motes more useful in phase 3 anyways since too many barrages at once in many diff directions.

	- tandanu via svn r12330: increment alpha version
