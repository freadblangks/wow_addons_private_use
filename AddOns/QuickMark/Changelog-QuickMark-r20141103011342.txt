stphung:
	- Version number correction.
	- Updated for 4.3, added border and background color/alpha configuration.
	- Updated version number for 4.2.
	- Changed frame strata to medium for ui overlapping standardization.
	- Removed debug printouts.
	- Working with 4.1, elegance isn't there but it works.
	- Using AceConfig to add user interface configuration, preserved the old command line access for the most part except for scaling because I don't think many or anyone scales using the command line.  Also replace the quickmark original frame with qmslick, I think it looks better and should get good feedback hopefully.  This is temporary until I add frame border and background configuration.
